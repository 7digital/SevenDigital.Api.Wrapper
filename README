Current usage:

artist/details endpoint
Artist artist = new FluentApi<Artist>()
		.WithParameter("artistId", "1")
		.Resolve()

Not all endpoints implemented yet, just Artist and some of Release.

Would like to move to this eventually:

var artist = new FluentApi<Artist>()
		.With.ArtistId(1)
		.For.Country("GB")
		.Resolve()
		
or similar.

Type knows about its endpoint via the [ApiEndpoint] attribute, e.g

[ApiEndpoint("artist/details")]
public class Artist{}

See example usage console app project for some more examples.
