Current usage:

artist/details endpoint
Artist artist = new FluentApi<Artist>()
						.WithParameter("artistId", "1")
						.Resolve()

Not all endpoints implemented yet, just Artist and some of Release.

Would like to move to this eventually:

var artist = new FluentApi<Artist>()
					.With.ArtistId(1)
					.For.Country("GB")
					.Resolve()
or similar.

Type knows about it's endpoint via the [ApiEndpoint] attribute, e.g

[ApiEndpoint("artist/details")]
public class Artist{}
