Current usage:

artist/details endpoint
Artist artist = Api<Artist>.Get
		.WithArtistId(1)
		.Please()

Not all endpoints implemented yet, just Artist and some of Release.

Type knows about its endpoint via the [ApiEndpoint] attribute, e.g

[ApiEndpoint("artist/details")]
public class Artist{}

Also - you can apply the following to a type to specify if the endpoint requires oauth
[OAuthSigned]
public class OAuthRequestToken{}

See example usage console app project for some more examples.
